I help organisations facing uncertainty make sense of their situation and identify possibilities for action.

Our world is living through an ongoing “polycrisis” or “metacrisis” characterised by increasing complexity, volatility and cascading risks. The assumptions of stability, perpetual growth and linear extrapolation of past events no longer hold, if they ever did.

As a deep generalist and systems thinker I can dive into whatever topic is of concern to you, while bringing out connections with areas you may not have considered. I help you see the choices available and their potential impacts, without sugar-coating or overselling. What you get with me is not big consulting house “best practice” but honest and practical insight tailored to your situation.
