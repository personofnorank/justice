We are living through a series of interconnected disruptions that have collectively been called a metacrisis or polycrisis. 
Every organisation now has to navigate a world of ecological, economic and political instability. The assumptions of multi-year plans, perpetual growth and linear extrapolation of past events no longer hold, if they ever did.

I help organisations to make sense of how this reality affects them and identify possibilities for action. I believe that sensemaking is essential for adaptation and survival.

Wicked problems and predicaments are on the rise - but critical, joined-up thinking that can help deal with them is in short supply. 
Interconnections and cascading risks mean that the problems we face don't live in silos - but our thinking all too often does.

As a deep generalist and systems thinker I bring new perspectives to your pain points, risks and existential questions. I help you see the choices available and their potential impacts, without sugar-coating or overselling. What you get with me is not big consulting house “best practice” but honest and practical insight tailored to your situation.
