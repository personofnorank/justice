If what you&#39;re saying is that good insights can be abused or misappropriated, this is surely true but not specific to adaptive leadership. We&#39;ve probably all met people who think being &#34;agile&#34; means you don&#39;t have to document or test anything...

One term that stood out for me is &#34;getting on the balcony&#34;. That high level view is essential to see the whole terrain, but perhaps this framing entails a risk of detachment? In systems lingo, you&#39;re always a part of the system you&#39;re working with rather than just an observer.
