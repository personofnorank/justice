The set of skills around sensemaking and organisational resilience can be applied to improve "standard" consulting engagements, or as a more bespoke piece of work to address a specific issue you're grappling with.

### Operational resilience
Build, improve or assure an operational resilience capability in your organisation, understanding not just regulatory or framework requirements but also the nuances of how your organisation works and what's most important to you. Tried and tested experience building, improving and assuring operational resilience in regulated industries.

### Operating model and organisation design
Diagnose issues with your operating model, or work with you to design and implement a new one. This is so much more than org charts and team structures - it's fundamentally about organisational culture and how people work together, which can't be designed on a slide but requires listening to and learning from the people who work for you. Chief of Staff experience in technology, risk and product functions; understanding of cybernetics and other forms of organisational systems thinking.

### Program management and turnaround
Stand up a program to deliver your objectives, understanding who the stakeholders are and what they need as well as how your organisation works in practice - not just the change management framework you use but the way things get done in your organisation. PRINCE2 certified, comfortable with Agile and SAFe but above all pragmatic, with practical experience of running new programs and turning around struggling ones.

### Complex situations

Engage me to help you frame, understand and decide what to do about a complex issue. I won't claim to predict the future or solve all your problems but I will help you understand challenges in your environment, internal factors that may make you less effective in adapting, and what you may be able to do about them. Experience with tricky situations and dilemmas ranging from racial equality legislation in South Africa, through competitive challenges in the European payments landscape to work with organisations promoting adaptation to climate change.
