### What is organisational resilience?
Resilience is the ability of an organisation to survive and thrive over time. While it is often understood as the ability to recover from shocks and disruption, it goes much wider than this to encompass the capability to adapt to a changing environment. This implies a willingness for the organisation to learn and develop rather than simply weather the storm and emerge unchanged. Innovation and disruption are buzzwords these days, but most organisations find it hard to innovate and disrupt themselves.

### What is sensemaking?
Sensemaking is the ability to understand, intellectually and intuitively, a situation in all its complexity and from different perspectives in a way that allows an appropriate response. While this may involve theories, frameworks and models it is not about fitting a messy reality into a neat conceptual schema. It is inherently pragmatic as it focuses on insights that allow you to do "the next right thing". The capability to make sense of situations in this way over time is what allows an organisation to be resilient. 

### Why do we need this? 

Sensemaking and resilience are the thread that runs through all the other topics you might bring in someone to help you with: purpose, culture, strategy, change management, operational excellence or risk. At various points most of these words have either been in my job title or been the basis of assignments I've worked on. But while they are distinct things, you won't do them justice by treating them in isolation.

Your purpose is what you do - not what it says in an official statement of purpose, but what the organisation actually does. Your culture is how you do things - again, not how anyone says it is but the habits and behaviours that affect how things really get done. Your strategy is where you put your focus and priorities - again (you can see the theme by now) not necessarily what it says in a strategy document, but what you actually invest in and pay attention to. Execution, via both change and operations, is all the practical ways you implement the strategy and get stuff done. Risk is not a formal list of things in a risk register, but the effect of uncertainty on all of the above.

If those descriptions more or less make sense, here's the thing: each of them affects each of the other ones. Your purpose affects your culture as what you're in business for will necessarily influence your ways of working; but equally, your culture or way of doing things can eventually change the nature of the organisation and what it does. Strategy is typically seen as a means to further your purpose, but the way you arrive at it can't help being influenced by cultural factors like how you discuss things, how information gets communicated through the organisation and how you make decisions. How the strategy is executed depends not just on the strategy itself but very much on the culture - in fact this is probably where cultural differences between organisations are most noticeable. Risk is always risk to your organisation's purpose, but mediated through cultural, strategic and practical execution factors that affect the chances of success or failure. 

Resilience is affected by all the previous factors, but also affects them because to be resilient means to adapt and evolve over time - your very purpose can change, along with all the other factors. That's why a) you should care about the resilience of your organisation as it navigates uncertainty and complexity, and b) you need people who don't see resilience in isolation but can understand the organisation as a whole and identify leverage points anywhere that may increase your ability to deal with uncertainty and complexity over time.

### How does this fit in with all the specialist skills we already have? 
Most people in organisations work in functions or silos - product, sales, tech, finance, HR, marketing... But the organisation itself is an entity in its own right that isn't just made up of these areas, any more than you make a person by taking separate body parts and and stitching them together. You have to be aware of what it does as a whole to get a better handle on what the parts do and how they work together. Sensemakers tend to be deep generalists, or polymaths, with a good understanding of several areas as well as the connections between them. That doesn't mean that a sensemaker knows everything, or that you don't need specialists. Sensemakers work well with specialists by respecting their expertise and knowing how to ask the right questions, join the dots between different areas and produce a synthesis that's useful for people who need to make a decision, at whatever level of the organisation.

### So this is just another consultancy?
This isn't the same as traditional consulting, where you may also go around interviewing people and writing up a final report. While there are many fine people in consulting, the industry tends to base its work on "best practices" or boilerplates that allow the majority of the hard work to be farmed out to relatively inexperienced people. Too often this means you end up "finding out" exactly what you already believed to start with. Sensemaking is a more subtle process of teasing out what was already there but not seen or acknowledged, making skillful use of models that fit the situation rather than fitting it into one you made earlier. You should end up with something "net new" that challenges your view of what you're doing, in a healthy way.
