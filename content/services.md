### Sensemaking

Engage me to help you frame, understand and decide what to do about a complex issue. I won't claim to predict the future or solve all your problems but I will help you understand challenges in your environment, internal factors that may make you less effective in adapting, and what you may be able to do about them.

### Interim roles

Do you need someone to stand up a new program, operating model, process or organisational function? You may not need a permanent headcount but need a dedicated resource to scope out the landscape, get things up and running and hand them over to BAU. I bring sensemaking to bear when understanding what needs to be included, how the parts need to work together in service of the whole and how it needs to be left so that you can run it after I'm done.

### Fractional roles

Need someone to look things over, stay on top of what's important and be an accountable point of contact for a few days a week, or month? I can tailor my enagement so that you get the level of detail and involvement that makes sense for you.
