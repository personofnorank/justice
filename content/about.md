I help organisations facing uncertainty and complexity make sense of their situation and identify possibilities for action.

---

Wicked problems and predicaments are on the rise - but critical, joined-up thinking that can help deal with them is in short supply. Every organisation now has to navigate a world of ecological, financial and political instability. The assumptions of multi-year plans, perpetual growth and linear extrapolation of past events no longer hold, if they ever did. Interconnections and cascading risks mean that the problems we face don't live in silos - but our thinking all too often does.

As a deep generalist and systems thinker I bring new perspectives to your pain points, risks and existential questions. I help you see the choices available and their potential impacts, without sugar-coating or overselling. What you get with me is not big consulting house “best practice” but honest and practical insight tailored to your situation.
