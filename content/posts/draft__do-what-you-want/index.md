When I was about 10 my grandmother in Germany gave me a copy of _Die unendliche Geschichte (The neverending story)_ by Michael Ende. Although I was a bookworm and had conversational German, I didn’t read very well in German and so was put off this large, dense-looking book. Decades later, with kids of my own, I picked it up to read to them and was blown away. Like all the best books aimed at children, it is not just for children and repays multiple readings for adults.

The hero, Bastian, is a bookish and unsportly boy who is unhappy at home and picked on at school. He ends up in possession of a magical book that pulls him into its own pages where he becomes free to write his own story, by virtue of wearing a talisman called Auryn on which are engraved the words TU WAS DU WILLST — DO WHAT YOU WANT. At first he uses this power to get all the things he feels he’s been missing — strength, good looks, adulation. But getting the things that he thinks are important always leaves him unsatisfied and wanting the next thing — and along the way he does terrible damage to his friends in the fantasy world he now inhabits. The book is the story of how he finds out what he really wants. Without giving away too much in case this makes you want to read it, what he wants turns out not to be a “thing” that you can “get”.

Do you know what you really want? As a young man I thought I knew. I wanted to build a fairer society. With this reasonable aspiration came a vast baggage of ideological certainty that was less reasonable. It took me a long time to crawl out from under the weight of dogmatism that I had allowed myself to be saddled with. I then decided, again not unreasonably, just to live my life, make a living without doing anything too terrible and try to be a decent person.
