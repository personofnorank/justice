Why don’t companies look like the VSM? Because of pathological autopoiesis.

Why does pathological autopoiesis happen? Because of the dominance of the left hemisphere — the original support function that gets too big for its boots.

Why does the left hemisphere become dominant, in companies that have a sense of purpose and interaction with their ecosystem? 

1.  Because of having to navigate a left hemisphere dominated world. This is conditioned by size and impact of the organisation, number of markets it operates in and number of products or services it sells— as these increase the legal and regulatory burden grows. So while in theory the VSM applies to all sizes of organisation, in practice it is harder for bigger ones because they are forced to give more independent authority to what should be support functions. 
2.  Because of internal competition and company politics. The more a company is split into separate teams, even ones that actually execute the company’s purpose as opposed to merely coordinating and supporting, the more potential there is for turf wars, empire building and other pathological activities. Of course chopping a whole up into pieces is also a speciality of the left hemisphere. Clearly the temptation to do this grows with the size of the organisation.

This maps with the intuition that smaller companies are more agile. It’s not a linear causation but smaller companies can avoid some of the things that drive pathological growth of support functions by more judicious targeting of the activities they pursue, and avoiding too much subdivision into potentially competing components. If you don’t go where the pathogen lives, you won’t get infected.
