### Sensemaking

Engage me to help you frame, understand and decide what to do about a complex issue. Strategy, operations, culture, future-readiness - whatever is of concern. Whatever you ask me to look at, I'll show you how it connects to other things too.

### Interim roles

Do you need someone to stand up a new program, operating model, process or organisational function? You may not need a permanent headcount but need a dedicated resource to scope out the landscape, get things up and running and hand them over to BAU. I bring sensemaking to bear when understanding what needs to be included, how the parts need to work together in service of the whole and how it needs to be left so that you can run it after I'm done.

### Fractional roles

Need someone to look things over, stay on top of what's important and be a point of contact for a few days a week, or month? I can tailor my enagement so that you get the level of detail and engagement that makes sense for you.
